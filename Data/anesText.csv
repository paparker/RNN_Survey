The biggest problem is selfish people, that do not want to see others get ahead.  They pick and choose who they want to hire for work.  The biggest problem is the lack of respect for each other, especially in these Hud Apartment housing units, based on income.  They intrude into people homes with un-necessary inspections, and intrude into people homes behind their backs when they are not at home. Invading their rights to privacy.  Some major problems is the economy, education, foreign affairs, military affairs, global affairs.","The Fiscal Cliff, where they want to tax middle class people, and they will lose about 2,000 dollars.  However, I feel some of these people cause so much un-necessary distractions, and misery in other people lives that maybe they deserve it.

They have business that ruin a person's bank account by sending checks into their bank accounts without proper authorization.  Causing un-necessary bank fees.

We need to reform welfare and other entitlement programs.  Everyone goes through tough times and might need some assistance, but people should have to work for what they get.  There is always trash that can be picked up on the side of the road or other jobs that people can do.  If someone is disabled give them a job they can do on the computer.  At the very minimum people on welfare should have to take a drug test.  It makes people feel good about themselves to work hard and earn money.  We need to stop just writing checks to people and give them a purpose so they can feel good about themselves and their contribution to society.  When we just write people a check, we are taking away their motivation and we are not helping them be productive.  We need to reform welfare so that people can understand how rewarding hard work is and to let people know that we can all make a difference in this",We need to get Americans working and motivate companies to bring their businesses to America.  We should support American businesses by buying American products whenever it is possible as well.,"The economy is the most important right now.  If we keep spending the way we are eventually China will collect on their debt by taking our National Parks or government owned land.  This may sound extreme, but how else will we pay them if they decide they want their money tomorrow?
